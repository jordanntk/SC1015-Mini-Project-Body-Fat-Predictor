## 1. Problem Definition

- Obesity is a major public health concern worldwide, as its prevalence has been increasing rapidly over the past few decades. Obesity can increase the risk of developing chronic health conditions such as heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, certain types of cancer, and more.
- Body Mass Index (BMI) is often used to assess our body as it is simple and inexpensive. However, BMI is not an accurate measure of body composition or overall health as it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, body shape or fat distribution.

- Body Fat percentage is a better indicator of overall health and obesity risk as it considers body composition more accurately, but it is expensive and time-consuming.
- Thus, our motivation for our project is to use machine learning to predict body fat percentage through simple body measurements

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis

## 3. Machine Learning Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Ridge Regression
3. K-Nearest Neighbor Regression

## 4. Conclusion

-Ridge Regression was the best machine learning model, followed by Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor Regression being the worst.
